# Galaxy Ellipticity Prediction with CNNs in the Fourier Space

## Overview
This project aims to predict galaxy ellipticity values from radio interferometric data, which is captured in Fourier space, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The data was simulated using the gal_sim repository (forked from itrharrison's rwl_sims repository), and custom preprocessing steps were applied to format the data for model training.
